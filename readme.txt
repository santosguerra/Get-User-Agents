WordPress plugin tracks User Agents, avoiding server log analysis. Records and exports data easily for further analysis.

== Description ==
WordPress plugin to keep track of User Agents that come to our website. This information is usually extracted from the server log, but in many cases it is a cumbersome process and a lot of valuable time is lost, so I decided to make a simple plugin that allows you to get the information without consuming resources and easily export it for further analysis.

A User Agent is a text string that identifies the software and hardware used by a client when accessing a website or online service. It typically includes information about:

- Web browser (type and version)
- Operating system
- Device (in the case of cell phones or tablets)
- Rendering engine
- Other client characteristics

Example User Agent:
'''Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36''''

User Agents' collection and analysis provides valuable insights for developers, analysts and security professionals, allowing to improve user experience and website effectiveness.

The information collected by this plugin can be used for:
* Search bots identification: Allows to identify search engine bots (such as Googlebot, Bingbot, etc.) that are crawling your site.
* Detection of technical problems.* Resource optimization.* Identification of malicious traffic.
* Verification of SEO tools.
* Traffic analysis.

== Installation ==
